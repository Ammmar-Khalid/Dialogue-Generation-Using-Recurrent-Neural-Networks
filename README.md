# Dialogue-Generation-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
# Introduction
-Background
Conversational agents have become pivotal in various domains, including customer service, personal
assistance, and entertainment. These agents utilize advanced technologies, such as neural networks, to
understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses.
-Problem Statement
Generating coherent and contextually relevant dialogue responses remains a challenge due to the
complexity of natural language understanding and generation.
-Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- Develop a GUI-based conversational agent using RNNs.
- Explore different RNN architectures, specifically LSTM and GRU.
- Design an intuitive and user-friendly GUI.
- Integrate the trained model into the GUI for real-time interaction.
- Evaluate the model's performance using qualitative and quantitative metrics.
